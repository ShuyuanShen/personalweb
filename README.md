## Welcome

I am a doctoral student in political science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My research focuses on public opinion and political communication in authoritarian regimes. My current project explores the impact of political censorship on collective action in authoritarian regimes. I am originally from China and received my B.S.Sc in Sociology from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Master of Global Affairs from the University of Notre Dame.
