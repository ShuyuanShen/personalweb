      <h2><br>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I am a Ph.D. student in political science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am broadly interested in political communication, information and communications technology (ICT), and public opinion in authoritarian regimes. My current project explores the deterrence effect of political censorship in autocracies with experiments. I have also done some work on the U.S. immigration detention and deportation policy and practice. I am originally from China.</p>

        <dd>Abstract: Various migration-related controversies in the United States and the 2015 migrant crisis in Europe have raised questions about destination countries’ treatment of migrants. This report, produced in collaboration with the department of Migration and Refugee Services of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, considers the post-arrival side of immigration enforcement in the United States, Greece, and Germany through a normative lens.</dd>

        <dt>Signaling Strength or Weakness? The Signaling Effect of Political Censorship on Collective Action</dt>
        <dd>Abstract: Censorship is one of the most effective tools for autocrats to control information and manipulate public opinion, especially during crises. Despite the growing attention to the strategic use of censorship in authoritarian regimes, most scholarly work focuses on the blocking effect of censorship — censorship blocks negative news or mobilization information and therefore reduces the likelihood of collective action against the regime. This paper argues that censorship not only stops information but also conveys information about the state’s capacity by signaling through the act of censorship itself — the signaling effect of censorship. Censorship distinguishes strong authoritarian regimes from weaker ones with the financial, political, and informational costs it requires, and therefore deters potential challengers from rebellion. With an innovative experimental design, this study shows that censorship makes people perceive the authority to be more powerful and deters them from rebellion. The effect, however, is only present when citizens recognize censored information. This study offers a new perspective on the function of censorship and contributes to the broader literature on state-citizen interaction and political communication in authoritarian regimes.</dd>

        <dt>Who to blame? Official accountability and public opinion in Covid-19 in China<br><small>with Xiaoli Guo, Lucie Lu, Yiqiang Wang, and Haocheng Yin</small></dt>
        <dd>Abstract: In this project, we analyze 10 million posts in Weibo to explore how holding local officials accountable in the Covid-19 affected the public’s perceptions of the central and local governments in China. Extant survey studies show that the public in China generally trust the central government more than local governments, and view the former as a monitor and punisher of the latter for malpractice and negligence (e.g. Saich, 2007; Liu, 2015; Li, 2013, 2016). The Covid-19 pandemic provides us with a good opportunity to examine whether this pattern of public opinion persisted in a severe public health crisis, and how the central government restored and strengthened its legitimacy by blaming and shifting responsibilities to local officials.</dd>
