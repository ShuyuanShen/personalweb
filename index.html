      <h1 id="header-1">Welcome!</h1>
      <p>I am a Ph.D. student in political science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I am broadly interested in political communication, information and communications technology (ICT), and public opinion in authoritarian regimes. My current project explores the deterrence effect of political censorship in autocracies with experiments. I have also done some work on the U.S. immigration detention and deportation policy and practice. I am originally from China.</p>

        <dd>Abstract: Various migration-related controversies in the United States and the 2015 migrant crisis in Europe have raised questions about destination countries’ treatment of migrants. This report, produced in collaboration with the department of Migration and Refugee Services of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, considers the post-arrival side of immigration enforcement in the United States, Greece, and Germany through a normative lens.</dd>

        <dt>Signaling Strength or Weakness? The Signaling Effect of Political Censorship on Collective Action</dt>
        <dd>Abstract: Censorship is one of the most effective tools for autocrats to control information and manipulate public opinion to enhance the stability and legitimacy of the regime. Despite the growing attention to the strategic use of censorship in authoritarian regimes, most scholarly work focuses on the direct effect of censorship on collective action---censorship prevents negative news or mobilization information. This paper argues that censorship not only stops the circulation of specific information but also conveys information about the state’s capacity by signaling through the act of censorship itself, which I call the indirect effect of censorship.</dd>
